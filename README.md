# E-commerce Customer Analysis

This repository contains the solution to the Data Science Assignment for an e-commerce company. The assignment involves analyzing customer and transaction data to derive insights, build a lookalike model, and perform customer segmentation.

## Files

*   **EDA.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook containing exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the e-commerce data.
*   **EDA.pdf:** PDF report summarizing the EDA and key business insights.
*   **Lookalike.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook detailing the development of the lookalike model.
*   **Lookalike.csv:** CSV file containing the top 3 lookalikes for the first 20 customers.
*   **Clustering.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook demonstrating customer segmentation using clustering techniques.
*   **Clustering.pdf:** Report on the clustering results, including the number of clusters, DB Index, and other relevant metrics.
*   **Customers.csv:** Dataset containing customer information.
*   **Products.csv:** Dataset containing product information.
*   **Transactions.csv:** Dataset containing transaction information.

## Assignment Tasks

### Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Business Insights

*   Performed EDA on the provided dataset to understand the data distribution, identify patterns, and uncover relationships between variables.
*   Derived 5 business insights from the EDA, providing valuable information for decision-making.

### Task 2: Lookalike Model

*   Built a lookalike model that recommends 3 similar customers based on their profile and transaction history.
*   Utilized both customer and product information to identify similar customers.
*   Assigned a similarity score to each recommended customer.

### Task 3: Customer Segmentation / Clustering

*   Performed customer segmentation using KMeans clustering techniques.
*   Used both profile information and transaction information for segmentation.
*   Calculated clustering metrics, including the DB Index, Silhouette Score, and Calinski-Harabasz Index.
*   Visualized the clusters using relevant plots.

## Note

*   Ensure that the datasets (Customers.csv, Products.csv, Transactions.csv) are in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebooks.
*   The code was developed using Python and popular data science libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.
*   Refer to the individual Jupyter Notebooks and PDF reports for detailed explanations and analysis.
